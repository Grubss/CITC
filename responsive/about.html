                The first bottomeless pit was discovered late 1976 by
                a "Elijah Fleming". Mr. Fleming had been hiking in the northern
                Tennessee area when he nearly stumbled into a newly formed 
                pit that had grown centered on the main hiking trail.
                Mr. Fleming had called park rangers to protect other hikers.
                By the time the park rangers arrived to the scene Mr. Fleming
                was nowhere to be seen. The only evidence that he had been There
                was a snapped rope and the sounds of ever quieter screams.
                The PCU was formed not long after this incident.

            <p>
                The PCU was formed about 2 years after the first discovery
                of bottemless pits when the American Government dictated
                that a specilized unit was need to deal with this emerging
                problem. We have since studied, tested, and explored these 
                phenomenon in the hopes of understanding and preventing futher
                occurences.
