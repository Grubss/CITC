                ULTRAKILL is a fast-paced ultraviolent old school first-person shooter developed by 
                Arsi "Hakita" Patala and published by New Blood Interactive. You play as V1, a combat 
                machine fueled by blood who has ventured into the depths of Hell after the extinction 
                of humanity. Hell abounds with demons and tormented souls, sources of blood that you 
                must rend apart in order to refuel yourself and survive.

                Arsi Patala also known as Hakita is the creator, 
                main developer, and composer of ULTRAKILL based in Finland.

                PITR is a programmer working on ULTRAKILL alongside Hakita. 
                if you look at the game's code and see anything done well it's probably by him.

                Even through ULTRAKILL has a large amount of content already 
                avaliable, the developers continue to push out more updates on
                a regular basis. For this reason the game is kept in the early
                access stage while they continue to work towards finishing the game.

                The main alure of ULTRAKILL is the fast paced combat that it offers to players.
                There is almost never a moment of peace for our robot protaganist as it is faced with
                hordes of ememies, God's servents, and even ancient mythos that have long been
                sealed away.
