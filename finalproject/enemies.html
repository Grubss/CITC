            <p>
                The first and weakest enemy type you'll encounter in the game is 
                known as the filth. as stated in the <a href="https://ultrakill.fandom.com/wiki/Filth">Ultrakill Wiki</a> "Filth are emaciated humanoids that lack arms, 
                eyes, and noses. Their only facial feature is a large gaping mouth lined with 
                jagged teeth, used to bite and tear. Their flesh is greyish green, with dried 
                blood covering their bodies."
                Only able to charge and lunge at the enemy, they are normally
                seen as blood bags or style points for the player to use.

            <p>
                The first 'boss' enemy that the player will encounter takes the form
                of a large floating head that can shoot projectiles. Known by the playerbase
                by it's nickmane of 'Maurice', this enemy can prove a challenge in certain
                situations. 'Maurice' has two diffrent attack types, quick fire, where it 
                unleashes a burst of weak projectiles, or a explosive burst which can deal
                high damage to the player. On top of all of that, this enemy is also immune to all
                explosive damage, which means certain weapons are completley off the table when 
                matched agianst it.

            <h3>Gaberial, Judge of Hell</h3>
            <img src="images/gaberial.webp" alt="Gaberial">
            <p>
                While many other enemies appear as bosses in prior levels, most of them
                pale before the holy light off Gaberial, an angel of the lord who has
                taken over the position as Judge of Hell after killing the previous Judge, King Minos.
                Gaberial is the second boss in the game to be a roadblock for novice players
                as his fight requires a large amount of skill and a strong understanding of
                the games mechanics. Throughout the fight the player must dodge split second
                attacks, parry at the right time to refelct projectiles, and know when is the right
                time to sneak in to regain health through blood. And all of that is only for his first
                fight. Upon the defeat of Gaberial and compleation of Act 2 of the game, the player will
                get to have a rematch with this astounding boss.
