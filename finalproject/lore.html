                ULTRAKILL's lore is what ties the game's story, environments and 
                gameplay together, creating a world around what the player experiences 
                throughout the game. Not much is known for sure, and the order of 
                which things happen is not clear..

        <p>ULTRAKILL's story opens with three sentances.</p>
        <H2>MANKIND IS DEAD.

            BLOOD IS FUEL.
            
            HELL IS FULL.</H2>
        <P>The game follows this core phrase to a tee througout the entire game.
            The protaganist, a robot named V1, enters hell to find more fuel.
            V1 was created by a war torn humanity, one so hell bent on fighting
            that they created a contraption to run purely on the blood of it's enemies.
            Well at some point humanity finally achived it's goal. The world was empty,
            and humanity was dead. 
            </P>

        <p>
            V1, the emotionless robotic killer now has to enter hell to fufil it's one and 
            only purpose.

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Act one of ULTRAKILL is packed through with violence and gore,
            but if you look closer you may see bits of lore beginning to poke out. 
            Throughout all of act 1 we see many diffrent signs of lore, from enemy descriptions,
            scenery in levels, and even secret levels that the player must find through varius
            means. There's more than I can go over here, so if you would like to learn the whole
            story you should visit <a href="https://ultrakill.miraheze.org/wiki/Lore">This Wiki Page</a>
            for a full overview.
        </p>
        <p>
            The quick summary though is that Hell has multiple rulers, each with diffrent ideas of how to 
            preside over their share of the underworld. One decides to make Hell a nice place to live
            while another decides to wage war agianst heaven. This is where Gaberial comes in to stop the 
            inssurection of Hell by killing the leaders. This includes the peaceful Judge of Hell, King Minos.
            Now Gaberial is tasked by heaven to be the new ruler of Hell, ensuring the continuous cycle
            of torment for sinners. We continue to progress through the game and learn more as even Gaberial
            after his first defeat begins to quesiton Heavon's council of angels. But what does all of that matter
            to us, after all the only thing we are here for... is blood.
