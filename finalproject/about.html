            <h2>Timeline</h2>
            <p>
                Ultrakill was first released on september 3 2020. It originally
                contained just the games prolougue and first act. Since then the game
                had progressed miles from where it began. The developers have since added
                a second act and are currently working on the third at the time of writing
                this. (4/28/2004) Not only are more levels avaliable, but the devs have also added
                more weapons and customization options.

            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>
                Similar to the conbat, another of the games most attracting features
                is undenaibly it's music. It perfectly matches the fast paced nature
                of the game and forces your body to make as much adreniline as possible.
                The producer of the music is none other than Hakita himself, so not only
                is he a talented game developer, but is also equally gifted with music skills.

            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>The goal of ultrakill is realativly simple. Kill everything in sight and do
                it in as cool of a way as you can. You play the game as a robot named V1 who's main
                directive is to gather blood which it uses as fuel. To do this you run through
                the 9 layers of hell, based off of dantes inferno, to kill anything that moves.
            </p>

                The game also spices up your murderous rampage by adding a scoring system. 
                As you progress through each level you will have a score ranging from the worst, 'D'
                for destructive, all the way to 'ULTRAKILL'. To raise your score the game requires 
                the player to kill their enemies in a varaity of ways. If you kill a enemy the games gives
                you 30 points. If you kill 3 enemies withen half a second you a awarded 100 points.
                The player will also be penilized by gaining less points if they continue to 
                use the same weapons for too long.
