        <h2>What the heck is Pizza?</h2>
        <p>
            Pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, 
            olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven 
            heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.

        <h2>History of Pizza.</h2>
        <p>
            Pizza dates back thousands of years, believe it or not, tracing its roots back to the flatbreads with toppings that were popular with
            ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. But modern pizza, the flatbreads with tomato sauce, cheese, and toppings, was born along the
            western coast of Italy, in the city of Naples.
