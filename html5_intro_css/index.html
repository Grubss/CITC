            <h2>Pizza Wars 2 Information Hut</h2>
            <p>
                As everyone who participated will remember, the first
                and the worst day of the second Pizza Wars was when a
                man from nebraska first insulted all of pizza culture 
                by putting a slice of pineapple atop his fresh slice of za.

            <p>
                For whatever reason, the pineapple "pizza" is regarded in some
                places as a delicacy. People will attest to the sweet flavor
                of the fruit adding to the savory flavor of the pizza. While
                this information remains ungrounded and often thought of as 
                nothing but hysterical rambling by those who have been brainwashed
                after eating a slice.
