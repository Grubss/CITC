                Shown below is one of the greatest tools ever invented.
                Yes, even better than the wheel. This allowed for the correct
                heating of pizza to allow for a crisp crust while also giving
                it a soft bread-like interior. 
                Sadly however, no matter how pure the intentions were in the 
                creation of this device, the fact remains that it is also the 
                tool that enabled the creation of the first forbidden slice.
                While it may be impossible for some to forgive this machine for
                what is has cause, we must remeber the good times it has given to us, 
                and allow our grivences to flow like tomato sauce. That is the only way
                to never let our enemies truly win.

                Finally, this is a colorized picture of the tragedy that occured
                back in 1962. When a passing italian man saw a gang of nebraskian
                hooligans disgracing the name of pizza itself. He heroically attempted
                to stop the villinous group, but was overpowered by their hate for all things
                right in this world. As the picture shows the italian was forced to watch
                as they commited sacralidge upon this innocent slice.
                While unkown for sure, it is said the chef who cooked the origianl slice
                shown in the image dropped dead of heartbreak the moment pineapple touched
                his heartfelt creation.
